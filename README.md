## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- Sass/SCSS
- Netlify functions

### What I learned

Most of the project was straight forward. Having done a few projects using JSON data, populating the DOM using that data wasn't difficult. My biggest challenge here was dealing with backend and hiding the github token. This was great as I got the chance to deploy the website using Netlify which I hadn't done before. I knew how to do the exact same process using node.js but since I didn't want to use a VPS, Netlify was a great option.

Another thing I learned with this project was using JavaScript to display the mode the user has set in the OS settings.

### Continued development

I plan to work on more JSON and API projects to build more confidence in those.
